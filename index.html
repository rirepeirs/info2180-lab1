 <h2>Rianna Pearson</h2>
 <p>I am a Computer Science Major at the University of the West Indies. 
    I like eating, surfing the web and not doing anything.I would like 
    to have a successful career in Computer Science to help fund my 
    regular trips to Italy and take care of my family. I am also
    a proud supporter of humans moving to Mars or the Moon so I can 
    have the earth to myself. I don't really have anything else to add
    and this makes five sentences which constitutes a paragraph, therefore, the end.</p>
